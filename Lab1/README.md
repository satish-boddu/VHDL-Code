#Lab 1: Structural VHDL #

Basics on structural VDHL, Read Lab Manual to understand, the solution files have been posted along with it.

Basic Difference between Behavioral and Structural VHDL
 -- Behavioral modeling refers to a way to write code (more precisely, to model your hardware design) based on its functionality: it's like writing the algorithm that solves your problem. 
 -- With structural code, on the other hand, you are connecting different parts together to get the final design.
